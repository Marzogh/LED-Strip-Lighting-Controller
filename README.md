# LED-Strip-Lighting-Controller
LED Strip lighting controller designs:

This code is for controlling LED strips for use as home lighting. The current version of the code takes user input from a copper tape based capacitive touch button (refer to schematics & BOM) and turns on or off an LED strip connected through a MOSFET. The brightness is automatically set through an LDR or a phototransistor.
